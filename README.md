# AI Food Stylist: Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion for Professional Food Photography

This project is a deep learning pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to become a specialized generator for high-quality, professional food photography. The model is trained on a curated subset of the Food-101 dataset, with rich, descriptive captions automatically generated by the BLIP model.

##  Key Features

* **LoRA Fine-Tuning:** Efficiently fine-tunes the Stable Diffusion 1.5 model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
* **Automated Data Preparation:** A script (`prepare_dataset.py`) that processes a raw classification dataset into a format suitable for generative model training.
* **Rich Caption Generation:** Utilizes the Salesforce BLIP model to create detailed text captions for each image, moving beyond simple class labels to provide rich context for the model to learn from.
* **Configurable Pipeline:** All paths, model IDs, and training parameters are managed in a central `config.py` file for easy modification.

## üçî Sample Generations
